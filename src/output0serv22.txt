Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the simulation and the output format, it's not possible to definitively determine which specific server sent a message to another server. The output only shows which server is sending a message and to which server ID.

However, we can still analyze the output and arrange it by server name in ascending order, indicating the messages received (Attack or Retreat) from other servers:

Server 0:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Unknown (implicit Attack messages based on reaching Attack consensus)
Server 1:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from Server 0)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 5), Retreat (from Server 18)
Server 2:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Server 3:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 7), Retreat (from Server 6), Attack (from Server 17), Attack (from Server 15)
Server 4:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server), Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 6), Retreat (from Server 12), Retreat (from Server 11), Retreat (from Server 10), Retreat (from Server 4) (sent by itself)
Server 5:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 6)
Server 6:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Retreat (from unknown server), Retreat (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Attack (from Server 17), Attack (from Server 3)
Server 7:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 3), Retreat (from Server 15)
Server 8:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 6), Retreat (from Server 21)
Server 9:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Unknown (implicit Attack messages based on reaching Attack consensus)
Server 10:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 16), Retreat (from Server 20), Retreat (from Server 11)
Server 11:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 4), Retreat (from Server 15)
Server 12:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 4)
Server 13:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server), Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 11), Retreat (from Server 20)
Server 14:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 20), Retreat (from Server 11)
Server 15:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Attack (from Server 17), Attack (from Server 11)
Server 16:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server), Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 4), Retreat (from Server 10)
Server 17:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Attack (from Server 15)
Server 18:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 1), Retreat (from Server 5)
Server 19:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Unknown (implicit Attack messages based on reaching Attack consensus)
Server 20:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Attack (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 14), Retreat (from Server 13)
Server 21:

Received messages (before reaching consensus): Retreat (from unknown server)
Received messages (after reaching consensus - Attack): Retreat (from Server 19), Retreat (from Server 8)
Key Points:

Due to the random nature of initial messages and peer communication, the order in which servers receive messages can vary in different simulation runs.
This analysis provides a general idea of the message flow based on the given output.
The "unknown server" notation indicates that the specific sender cannot be determined from the provided output format.
Additional Considerations:

If you need to track the exact message flow with senders and receivers, modifications to the code to record this information during message transmission would be necessary.
The current implementation assumes reliable message delivery, which might not be realistic in real-world scenarios. You could explore introducing message loss or delays to simulate a more complex communication environment.
